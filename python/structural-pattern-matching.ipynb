    "# A Gentle Introduction to Structural Pattern Matching in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When new features are added to Python, sometimes it can take a while to learn about and start using the feature. For me, structural pattern matching is a good example. Some features are very easy to grasp and start using (for example, f-strings), but structural pattern matching can be confusing for developers who have not been exposed to it before. Some try to relate it to the wrong language feature in their past experience. In this article, I'll introduce a few foundational concepts about the feature, then describe it in more detail, and provide some practical examples of how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural pattern matching was first made available in Python 3.10.  Functional programming languages such as scala make heavy use of structural pattern matching, and Python's implementation is influenced by ideas from other languages. If you haven't used this feature in another language before, hopefully this article will introduce it to you and show you how it can be useful in your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the code in this article, you have to be running Python 3.10 or above or you will get the following error on the `match` statement: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python 3.10, I recommend using [pyenv](https://www.wrighters.io/you-can-easily-and-sensibly-run-multiple-versions-of-python-with-pyenv/). Pyenv allows you to have multiple versions of Python on your workstation. Here's what I did to install 3.10.4 on my laptop after installing Pyenv. (3.10.4 was the latest version of 3.10 when I wrote this, you might choose to install any version above 3.10.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pyenv install 3.10.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I used [pyenv-virtualenv](https://www.wrighters.io/use-pyenv-and-virtual-environments-to-manage-python-complexity/) to make a virtual environment to work with the new 3.10 install.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pyenv virtualenv 3.10.4 python-matching\n",
    "pyenv activate python-matching\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you installed Python another way, you can use that version to follow along, as long as it's 3.10 or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "What is Structural Pattern Matching? Before we get to that, let's back up and start with a few Python basics first. As I was reading about this feature, I found a review of these topics helpful. \n",
    "\n",

It's not intended to be used strictly as a `switch`. This error message might be a bit confusing.  What it is saying is that you have three branches of your match that are all trying to match the same thing: a case where the length of the `values` list can be _assigned to_ a single variable. This is not checking the _value_ of the length of `values`. There is a way to do that, however, if you needed to.

    "\n",
    "You have already seen how we can match on a sequence of various sizes. Let's layer on more complex functionality.  Let's say that you have a configuration for an application, perhaps something that is stored in a configuration file or a database. You need to use this configuration to properly configure and run your application. Over the course of several steps, we will build up a more complicated configuration and show how structural pattern matching will make our code more readable and maintainable. For each step, I'll create two ways of processing the configuration and you can decide which works better.\n",

    "* technical spec [PEP 634](https://peps.python.org/pep-0634)\n",
    "* motivation and rationale [PEP 635](https://peps.python.org/pep-0635)\n",
    "* tutorial [PEP 636](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/)\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading this far, you've seen a _lot_ of examples. I hope you've learned something about how structural pattern matching works in Python and how it can help you write cleaner, more maintainable, and more understandable code."

    "Pandas is great for dealing with both numerical and text data. In most projects you'll need to clean up and verify your data before analysing or using it for anything useful. Data might be delivered in databases, csv or other formats of data file, web scraping results, or even manually entered. Once you have loaded data into pandas, you'll likely need to convert it to a type that makes the most sense for what you are trying to accomplish. In this post, I'm going to review the basic datatypes in pandas and how to safely and accurately convert data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DataFrame and Series\n",
    "First, let's review the basic container types in pandas, ```Series``` and ```DataFrame```. A ```Series``` is a one dimensional labeled array of data, backed by a ```NumPy``` array. A ```DataFrame``` is a two-dimensional structure that consists of multiple Series columns that share an index. A Series has a data type, referenced as [```dtype```](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.dtypes.html), and all elements in that ```Series``` will share the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But what types?\n",
    "The data type can be a core ```NumPy``` datatype, which means it could be a numerical type, or Python object. But the type can also be a pandas extension type, known as an ```ExtensionDType```. Without getting into too much detail, just know two very common examples are the ```CategoricalDType```, and in pandas 1.0+, the ```StringDType```. For now, what's important to remember is that all elements in a ```Series``` share the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What's important to realize is that when constructiong a ```Series``` or a ```DataFrame```, pandas will pick the datatype that can represent all values in the ```Series``` (or ```DataFrame```). Let's look at an example to make this more clear.\n"

    "What I recommend doing is looking at your raw data once it is imported. Depending on your data source, it may already be in the dtype that you want. But once you need to convert it, you have all the tools you need to do this correctly. For numeric types, the ```pd.to_numeric``` method is best suited for doing this conversion in a safe way, and with wise use of the ```downcast``` parameter, you can also save space. Consider using ```astype(\"category\")``` when you have repeated data to save some space as well. The ```convert_dtypes``` and ```infer_objects``` methods are not going to be that helpful in most cases unless you somehow have data stored as objects that is readily convertible to another type. Remember, there's no magic function in pandas that will ensure you have the best data type for every case, you need to examine and understand your own data to use or analyze it correctly. But knowing the best way to do that conversion is a great start."

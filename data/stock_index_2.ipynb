    "# Matching messy data between data sources with Python  \n",
    "Data is often messy and rarely in perfect shape. This is especially true if the data comes from many different sources and the specifications are loosely defined. If your data is in great shape, it's probably because someone else did the dirty work of validating it, cleaning it up, and normalizing it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular type of problem is matching data between data sources when exact identifiers are missing. This situation has come up for me quite often.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to match data, there are a number of techniques that can help. The best way to illustrate this is with a concrete example. To do this, we'll pull data from the SEC's EDGAR system. You can read the [initial article](https://www.wrighters.io/an-introduction-to-accessing-financial-data-in-edgar-using-python/) to learn how to connect to EDGAR and fetch data, and [another article](https://www.wrighters.io/finding-and-analyzing-free-stock-index-data-with-python-and-edgar/) to learn about stock index data in EDGAR. In this article, we'll use some of the stock index data to demonstrate some matching techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we'll look at multiple ways to try to match data between two data sources. In our case, it will be a company name. We'll use the following techniques:\n",
    "1. Merging with exact data\n",
    "1. Cleaning data with a regular expression (and then trying to match again)\n",
    "1. Picking the best data with duplicates using `groupby`\n",
    "1. Fuzzy searching\n",
    "1. Good old manual verification and cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "## A quick review\n",
    "If you don't want to read the earlier articles, I'll give you a very quick summary of how we got to this point. We found a filing on EDGAR that contains all the investments in an ETF. That filing has an XML document that lists the investments, and if we pick an ETF that tracks a stock index, we can use that filing to build the index holdings. At this point, we want to match the index holding up with all of their other data that is stored in EDGAR. This will allow us to build a rich database of information about all the stocks in an index, for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "Once we dig into the data, we will start to recognize the problem. The stocks that are held by the ETF are listed by name and CUSIP. We need to figure out how to match the investments in the N-PORT document to EDGAR's internal system for tracking companies, using other identifiers. But all we have to match on is the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we'll learn\n",
    "Along the way, we will learn a few things about dealing with messy data.  If you happen to like financial data, you'll also learn a bit more about how EDGAR works and its internal data. If your domain is outside of finance, the techniques will still work for matching data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So let's just go through the basic steps from the last article and get the stock index data. Note that I am putting a little bit of code in a python file, you can always get the code (and the notebook used to generate this article) on [github](https://github.com/wrighter/python_blogposts)."

    "## Assessing the exact matches\n",
    "I see several issues. First, some of the symbols show up more than once (`FOXA`, `FOX`), and some of the titles show up multiple times (`Fox Corp`, `Public Storage`, `Synchrony Financial`, `Paramount Global`). Why does this happen? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in some cases, companies might have more than one publicly traded common stock listing. If that's the case, and they are in the S&P 500, then they will have *both* stocks in the index. In other cases, companies may have other shares listed that are preferred shares. In still other cases, the companies may have different classes of shares, and only one class of shares are part of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will need a better solution than a simple match on title. We will need to consider two issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fact that the title doesn't match exactly\n",
    "1. The fact that matching companies may have more than one matching symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a bit of extra info in that the symbol to CIK mapping appears to be sorted by search popularity or market cap, so we use this information to weight the first match more heavily if we find multiple matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a simple matching algorithm to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first attempt at improving matching on title\n",
    "Since this data is somewhat messy, let's see if we can get better than 10% of the names to match. Consider two of the names we looked at above, Apple and Microsoft. For Microsoft, we could force the title to all upper or all lower case and get a match. For Apple, we could remove puncuation. It also makes sense to remove some common words found in many of the company names, especially the trailing `/The`. We can do this using regular expressions with `replace` on string columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, regular expressions can be a confusing topic. Don't look at this one and think I did this in one step. Instead, here's the approach I used. First, I looked at the top 50 values in the `DataFrame`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "symbol_to_cik[\"title\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I started to chain methods the pandas string methods, starting with converting all the strings to upper case, and adding regular expressions to replacing words one at a time, re-executing the cell with the code until it gave me the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after doing that, I found that it needed tweaking a few times after I continued through the process in this article. This is what I ended up with, with a full explanation of the regex (note you can't run the code with these comments inline, you need to run what is in the cells below. To follow along at home, you can just try these lines one at a time to see what changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "symbol_to_cik[\"title\"].str                 # use the pandas string methods\n",
    "    .upper()                               # convert to upper case so words match\n",
    "    .replace(r\"\\.|\\,|&\", \" \", regex=True)  # replace punctuation with space, (,.&)\n",
    "    .replace(r\"\\/(\\w+)?(\\/)?\", \" \", regex=True)  # replace words like this /xx/ with a space\n",
    "    .replace(r\"\\s(CO[M|S|R]?P?|INC|PLC|LP|NA|NV|CU|LTD)(?=\\s|$)\", \"\", regex=True)  # remove common words\n",
    "    .replace(r\"\\s+\", \" \", regex=True).str.strip() # remove all extra spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also break this line down a bit more. This expression might be a bit confusing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "r\"\\s(CO[M|S|R]?P?|INC|PLC|LP|NA|NV|CU|LTD)(?=\\s|$)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is saying match a space, followed by the word COM or COS or COR or CORP or INC or PLC or LP or NA or NV or CU or LTD followed by a space or the end of the line. The `?=` is a lookhead, so it's checking that the space or end of line exists in order to match, but it doesn't consume it in the replacement. This allows us to replace multiple matching words in a row, like in `Amazon.com Inc` (which becomes `AMAZON COM INC`)."

In our case, we are grouping by `title-search`, but since the data is sorted by \"most popular\", we can choose the first match. So an approach using `groupby`, with `first()` works well.

    "# An introduction to accessing financial data in EDGAR, using Python\n",
    "Some sources of financial data can be expensive or difficult to find. For example, some is only available from exchanges or vendors who charge a hefty fee for access. However, the financial industry is also heavily regulated, and one of its main regulators provides free access to its data. The (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)[https://www.sec.gov] (known as the SEC), has the mission of protecting investors and ensuring that markets are fair, orderly, and efficient. Companies and individuals are highly incentivized to provide the SEC with accurate and timely information about their businesses, or risk fines or criminal prosecution. Most of this information is provided by filling out forms, and the data in those forms are known as filings. The filing data is all available, for free, via the SEC's [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access) system. In this article, I'll show you the basics of how to access EDGAR filings using Python, then show you an examples of querying multiple filings from EDGAR. Along the way, you'll learn about a few useful Python libraries and techiques, as well as how to deal with some difficult data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not interested in finance, the techniques we use here for cleaning up the data can be useful in other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we access data using Python, it helps to poke around in the system a bit using a web browser. If you try the [main search page](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/), you can type in a company name and the interface will helpfully give you results for that company. For instance, searching a popular name like \"Apple\" will show you various filings related to Apple Inc. There are dozens of different filings related to Apple, and you can click on the links and read them in a human readable format. For example, when I ran this search, the top link was for an insider trading transaction. In this case, an insider (usually a director or officer in the company) bought or sold some stock in Apple and is required to report that to the SEC, using a form. The full rules for filling out [SEC Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form4data.pdf) are available if you find that sort of thing interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filing has a human readable document, like [this one](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000032019322000063/xslF345X03/wf-form4_165248105838188.xml), and a link to the [actual filing data](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000320193/000032019322000063/0000320193-22-000063-index.html). In this case, the filing contains the following:\n",
    "* an [HTML document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000063/xslF345X03/wf-form4_165248105838188.xml) that renders nicely in a web browser\n",
    "* an [XML document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000063/wf-form4_165248105838188.xml) that contains the data in the form\n",
    "* and a [text document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000063/0000320193-22-000063.txt) that contains the full submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last text document is actually in [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language), which is a predecessor to XML. We will parse that document later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing data using Python\n",
    "I won't spend any more time digging into the search interface, but you can definitely get plenty of data without writing code. There are number of useful tools for searching company filings, and many users will be able to use Edgar effectively in that manner. But we want to understand how to automate collection of useful data from EDGAR. Now that you've seen what a basic filing looks like, let's try to access the data using Python. I'll stick with the example of our insider trading transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Edgar site give us [some rules](https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data) about how we are to access the data using a computer program. I'd encourage you to check the details out, but I'll summarize the important points here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 10 requests per second\n",
    "You need to limit your requests to only 10 requests per second. If you request more than that, you risk being blocked. Note that the code I'm writing in this article will be run for only one document at a time on one computer. It's highly unlikely that I will break this rule, but if you run multiple processes this is highly likely to cause you trouble. You should plan in inserting some throttling code to ensure you don't exceed the limits if you'll be fetching large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User agent requirement\n",
    "The API for EDGAR uses simple HTTP with no authentication. You do need to supply a company name and administrative email in your HTTP headers. If you don't, your request will be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accept compressed data\n",
    "Your user agent needs to accept compressed content, using gzip or deflate. \n",
    "\n",
    "With just those three pieces of information, we can continue. Let's use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API to access the form above, with custom headers. Requests will accept the compressed data."

But EDGAR helpfully provides a reference between CIK and stock ticker for those public companies with a stock ticker. Since every filing will be under a CIK, we'll use this cross-reference to find the CIK. I suspect that this document is sorted by search popularity, when you see the top 5 entries."

    "OK, we now have 17 insider transactions in Apple for the first quarter of 2022. Let's download the documents and build a pandas `DataFrame` of the transaction data. The first step is to make a function that downloads the correct filing. All EDGAR filings are found in the form `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/[CIK]/[Accession Number]/[Document]`. We already know the CIK. The Accession Number is available in our `DataFrame`. Given a row, we can return the URL. Note that the Primary Document listed is the human readable document. We want to access the raw filing data which is in SGML. Using that, we can extract the XML content. We also remove the `-` in the directory for the accessionNumber, but not the document itself.\n",

As a result, we have to wrestle with the data and figure out how to bend it to our will. In this case, I'm going to check the case of the root element, and use two different sets of XPath expressions to retrieve our data. This is a hack, but will hopefully get us to the next step"

The data consists of filings, which are submitted by individuals and companies as required by the SEC. It's possible to access all the EDGAR data using HTTP APIs. Some of that data can be very messy, but with a little bit of creative Python code, we can extract what we're looking for.\n",
